# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

Your answer: The this keyword allows the document to know what method or object we are calling, without it the computer would not know where or what the method is that we are calling. I have used method several times since using React for example I just used it in the react-debugging.html activity and the code was broken because they forgot to put the this. keyword so the computer had no idea where the method was coming from.

Researched answer: The this keyword in javascript refers to an object. Which object depends on how it is called it can refer to different objects also. The this keyword is mainly used in the global context.

2. What is React? Why would you use it?

Your answer: React is a programming language that creates a smooth, efficient, and adaptive user interface all without reloading the page. A very famous example of React is Facebook, which is built with React allowing the user to click the like button which changes colors, sends a notification to the user, and tallys how many people have liked the post all without reloading. An example of when I have used it was with the Pig Latin challenge we create a website that can translate English words into piglatin all without reloading the page.

Researched answer: React allows devs to create a large website or application that can change data all without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It can only be used on applications with user interfaces.

3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

Your answer: Render which is a lifecycle method in React is necessary for the page to constantly update and change the data that the user sees. Everytime the user clicks on something render is responsible for finding that component in the virtual DOM, isolating it, and making specific changes to that component. I have used render when creating a React Application everything that we want to display on the screen needs to be in the rendeer method, all inside of a return as well.

Researched answer: Render is the most used lifecyle method and is required to have in a class component in React. Render is simply what tells React what to display onto the page. It displays the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.

4. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a language we use in React it is mainly a combination of HTML and JavaScript. Even though it is a combination there are some syntax differences when using it. For example when you are assigning a method, variable, or pretty much anything instead of using "", we use {} instead. I have used JSX whenever I am inside a React application. I have specifically used the different syntax variations when I assigned an onClick to a function.

Researched answer: JSX stands for Javascript XML, it allows devs to write HTML in React, it also makes it easier to add HTML in React. One main difference from HTML and JSX is that in JSX you can only return on thing and in order to do that we wrap everything we want to display in either a div or a React fragment.

5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: Yarn is a key word we use in out terminal before we create a new React application and when we are about to run jest testing. Although I dont quite know exactly what it means when we use it in terminal it does download node modules and is necessary to run testing and create a react application. I have used it several times but one for example is in the code-challenges.test.js we need to test our code and I had to use yarn to get that working.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager for code. It allows devs to use and share code with other devs all over the world quickly, securely, and reliably.
