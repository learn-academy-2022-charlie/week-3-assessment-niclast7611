# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

Your answer: The this keyword allows the document to know what method or object we are calling, without it the computer would not know where or what the method is that we are calling. I have used method several times since using React for example I just used it in the react-debugging.html activity and the code was broken because they forgot to put the this. keyword so the computer had no idea where the method was coming from.

Researched answer: The this keyword in javascript refers to an object. Which object depends on how it is called it can refer to different objects also. The this keyword is mainly used in the global context.

2. What is React? Why would you use it?

Your answer: React is a programming language that creates a smooth, efficient, and adaptive user interface all without reloading the page. A very famous example of React is Facebook, which is built with React allowing the user to click the like button which changes colors, sends a notification to the user, and tallys how many people have liked the post all without reloading. An example of when I have used it was with the Pig Latin challenge we create a website that can translate English words into piglatin all without reloading the page.

Researched answer: React allows devs to create a large website or application that can change data all without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It can only be used on applications with user interfaces.

3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

Your answer: Render which is a lifecycle method in React is necessary for the page to constantly update and change the data that the user sees. Everytime the user clicks on something render is responsible for finding that component in the virtual DOM, isolating it, and making specific changes to that component. I have used render when creating a React Application everything that we want to display on the screen needs to be in the rendeer method, all inside of a return as well.

Researched answer: Render is the most used lifecyle method and is required to have in a class component in React. Render is simply what tells React what to display onto the page. It displays the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.

4. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a language we use in React it is mainly a combination of HTML and JavaScript. Even though it is a combination there are some syntax differences when using it. For example when you are assigning a method, variable, or pretty much anything instead of using "", we use {} instead. I have used JSX whenever I am inside a React application. I have specifically used the different syntax variations when I assigned an onClick to a function.

Researched answer: JSX stands for Javascript XML, it allows devs to write HTML in React, it also makes it easier to add HTML in React. One main difference from HTML and JSX is that in JSX you can only return on thing and in order to do that we wrap everything we want to display in either a div or a React fragment.

5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: Yarn is a key word we use in out terminal before we create a new React application and when we are about to run jest testing. Although I dont quite know exactly what it means when we use it in terminal it does download node modules and is necessary to run testing and create a react application. I have used it several times but one for example is in the code-challenges.test.js we need to test our code and I had to use yarn to get that working.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager for code. It allows devs to use and share code with other devs all over the world quickly, securely, and reliably.

6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: I dont think I have ever expierenced or used an anonymous function but a normal function is a reusable piece of code that we can invoke whenever wherever, significatly reducing the amount of typing the dev has to do. If I were to guess what an anonymous function is I would guess it is a function with no name.

Researched answer: I was suprisingly right, an anonymous function is a function without a name so when the dev is creating the function instead of doing const function name and then arrow syntax, you just do const and arrow syntax. However with an anonymous function you cannot call it after creation because it does not have a name to call.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Conditional rendering is the ability to render different UI's based on the outcome of a true or false statement. So in React it allows the dev to render different elements and or components based on the condition.

2. Object-oriented programming:OOP os a computer programming model that organizes software design around data or objects instead of functions and logic.

3. Ruby:Ruby is an interpreted high level general purpose programming language which emphasises productivity and simplicity, everything in ruby is an object including primitive data types.

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby blocks are anonymous functions that can be passed into methods. They are enclosed in curly brackets if in a single line and do-end statements if in multiple lines.

5. Ruby hashes: Ruby hashes are a collection of unique keys and their values. Kind of like an array but instead of accessing a value using the index hashes use object types so key value pairs.
